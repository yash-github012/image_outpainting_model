# Image Outpainting Project

## Overview

This project implements an image outpainting technique that adds 128 pixels to each side of the input image using machine learning models. The outpainting process enhances the image by generating contextually relevant extensions of the original image, making it suitable for various applications such as artwork completion, background extension, and more.

## Features

- Adds 128 pixels to each side of the original image.
- Utilizes advanced deep learning models for high-quality outpainting.
- Easy-to-use interface for image input and output.
- Supports various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `diffusers`
  - `PIL` (Pillow)
  - `numpy`
  
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers Pillow numpy
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-outpainting.git
   cd image-outpainting
   ```

2. Install the required libraries as mentioned above.

## Usage

1. Place the input image in the designated folder (e.g., `input/`).
2. Run the main script to perform the outpainting:

   ```bash
   python main.py --input_path input/your_image.jpg --output_path output/outpainted_image.jpg
   ```

3. The outpainted image will be saved in the specified output path.
